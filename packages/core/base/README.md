# Wallet Standard

This package outlines the Wallet Standard.

The purpose of this standard is to improve the user experience of wallets.

We intend for this standard to become broadly adopted by wallets and dapps.

## Code

- [`Wallet` and `WalletAccount`](src/wallet.ts) interfaces
- Global [`window`](src/window.ts) events
- Wallet [`registerWallet`](../wallet/src/register.ts) function
- App [`getWallets`](../app/src/wallets.ts) function
- [Example](../../example/wallets/src/window.ts) of how wallets attach to the window
